## Domain and server from Contabo..


For a minimalist POS for importing and selling electric products, focus on just three domains: **Products**, **Sales (Billing)**, and **Basic Reports**. Components and APIs below are sized to what you actually need for a small trading business.[1][2]

## React components to create

### Layout & navigation  
- `AppLayout` (sidebar/topbar with links: Products, POS, Reports).  
- `AuthPage` (optional simple login form).  

### Products (inventory)  
- `ProductListPage`  
  - Table with search by name/code, stock, buy price, sell price, GST, and actions Edit/Delete.[3][1]
- `ProductForm`  
  - Used for Add/Edit product. Fields:  
    - Product code (also used as barcode value).  
    - Name / description.  
    - Purchase price (from China, in your base currency).  
    - Landed cost fields (optional: shipping, customs, other charges).  
    - GST rate and selling price (incl. GST).  
    - Opening stock quantity and reorder level.  
- `BarcodePreview`  
  - Shows generated barcode for current product code so you can print labels.  

### POS / Billing  
- `PosPage`  
  - Left side:  
    - Input to scan or type product code (works with barcode scanner as keyboard).[2]
    - Product search list (optional) for manual selection.  
  - Center: **CartItemsTable** showing line items (product, qty, price, line total).  
  - Right summary panel:  
    - Subtotal, discount, special discount, GST, grand total.  
    - Customer name (optional), payment mode, “Save & Print” button.  
- `ReceiptView`  
  - Minimal invoice/receipt layout with store details, items, totals, and a barcode/QR of invoice number for easy lookup.  

### Reports (very small set)  
- `DailySalesReportPage`  
  - Date picker + table summarizing total sales, total GST, total profit for the day.[4][1]
- `StockReportPage`  
  - List of products with current stock and low-stock highlight so you know what to reorder from China.[5][1]

## .NET Core API (controller endpoints)

Use ASP.NET Core Web API with Entity Framework Core and MySQL/SQL Server. Tutorials on building controller-based APIs show the same pattern of CRUD controllers and DbContext setup.[6][7]

### Entities (simplified)

- `Product`  
  - Id, Code, Name, PurchasePrice, LandedCost, SellPrice, GstRate, CurrentStock, ReorderLevel, IsActive.  
- `Sale`  
  - Id, InvoiceNumber, DateTime, CustomerName, Subtotal, Discount, ExtraDiscount, GstAmount, TotalAmount, PaymentMode.  
- `SaleItem`  
  - Id, SaleId, ProductId, Quantity, UnitPrice, GstRate, LineTotal, ProfitPerUnit (optional).  

### Controllers

1. **ProductsController**  
   - `GET /api/products` (with optional search query).  
   - `GET /api/products/{id}`  
   - `POST /api/products`  
   - `PUT /api/products/{id}`  
   - `DELETE /api/products/{id}` (soft delete recommended).  
   - `GET /api/products/by-code/{code}` (for POS scan lookup).  

2. **SalesController**  
   - `POST /api/sales`  
     - Accepts cart items, calculates subtotal, discounts, GST, total, and writes `Sale` + `SaleItem` rows; also decreases product stock.[7][1]
   - `GET /api/sales/{id}` (for receipt view).  
   - `GET /api/sales?date=2025-12-18` (daily sales listing).  

3. **ReportsController** (simple)  
   - `GET /api/reports/daily-summary?date=...`  
     - Returns totals: sales amount, GST collected, gross profit (sales – purchase cost).  
   - `GET /api/reports/stock`  
     - Returns product stock list, marking items below reorder level.  

4. **AuthController** (optional but good)  
   - `POST /api/auth/login` returning JWT; React uses it to protect POS and admin screens.

## How front end and API connect

- React components call these endpoints with `fetch`/Axios; for example, `PosPage` uses `/api/products/by-code/{code}` to add a line item when you scan a product, and `POST /api/sales` when you complete the bill.[8][9]
- Reports pages call the summary endpoints to show simple tables; you can add charts later if needed.[1][4]

If you want, the next step can be a concrete DB schema (tables + columns) tailored to your electric-parts import business and how to store purchase/import costs so profit is accurate.
